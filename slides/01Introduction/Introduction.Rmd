# The term no one really defined

- What is data science? `r emo::ji("confused")`

> Data science is the discipline of making data useful.  Ok...so what is it?

# Three tracks of data science

- Engineering (infrastructure and production): the process of making everything else possible 

- Analysis: the process of turning raw information into insights in a fast way

- Modeling/Inference: the process of diving deeper into the data to discover the pattern we don't easily see


(It is a group work from https://github.com/brohrer/academic_advisory/blob/master/authors.md !)

# Engineering

(1) Data environment: data storage, Kafka platform, Hadoop and Spark cluster etc.

(2) Data management:  parsing the logs, web scraping, API queries, and interrogating data streams. 

(3) Production: integrate model and analysis into the production system

# Analysis

(1) Domain knowledge

(2) Exploratory analysis

(3) Storytelling

# Modeling

**Problem to solve**:

- Prediction/classification: image recognition, machine translation, spam/not_spam

- Explanation: customer segmentation, feature prioritization

- Causal inference: vaccine effectiveness, policy change

`r emo::ji("key")` **Questions**

- Do we want to intervene? 

- Is the cost of an error too high?

- Does the problem have a simple objective?

# `r emo::ji("bulb")` Waffle Houses and Divorce Rate

- An example from [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)
- You can get the data [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pymc-devs/resources/master/Rethinking/Data/WaffleDivorce.csv)

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(rethinking)
data(WaffleDivorce)

d <- WaffleDivorce 
d = d %>% select(Location, WaffleHouses, South, MedianAgeMarriage, Marriage, Divorce) 
head(d)
```

# `r emo::ji("bulb")` Waffle Houses and Divorce Rate

```{r}
library(corrplot)
correlation = cor(d %>% select(-Location))
corrplot.mixed(correlation, order = "hclust", tl.pos = "lt", 
    upper = "ellipse")
```


# `r emo::ji("bulb")` Waffle Houses and Divorce Rate

```{r}
library(dagitty)
dag <- dagitty( "dag {
    South -> WaffleHouses
    South -> MedianAgeMarriage
    MedianAgeMarriage -> Divorce
    MedianAgeMarriage -> Marriage
    Marriage -> Divorce
}")
plot(graphLayout(dag))
```

# Some confusions and more to come

- **Data infrastructure engineer**: _Go,Python, AWS/Google Cloud/Azure, logstash, Kafka, and Hadoop_
- **Data engineer**: _spark/scala, python, SQL, AWS/Google Cloud/Azure, Data modeling_
- **BI engineer**: _Tableau/looker/Mode etc, data visualization, SQL, Python_ 
- **Data analyst**: _SQL, basic statistics, data visualization_
- **Data scientist**: _R/Python, SQL, basic + applied statistics, data visualization, experimental design_
- **Research scientist**: _R/Python, advanced statistics + experimental design, ML, research background, publications, conference contributions, algorithms _
- **Applied scientist**: _Similar to research scientist, ML algorithm design, often with an expectation of basic software engineering skills_
- **Machine Learning Engineer**: _More advanced software engineering skillset, algorithms, machine learning algorithm design, system design_

# Types of Questions (Modeling/Analytics)

- Comparison: 
    - Are males more inclined to buy our products than females?
    - Are there any differences in customer satisfaction in different business districts?
    - Do soybean carrying a particular gene have higher oil content?

- Description:
    - Is the distribution of annual income normal?
    - Are there outliers?
    - What are the means of different customer segments?

- Clustering:
    - Which customers have similar product preferences? 
    - Which printer performs a similar pattern to the broken ones?
    - How many different themes are there in the corpus?

# Types of Questions (Modeling/Analytics)

- Classification:
    - Who is more likely to buy our product?
    - Is the borrower going to pay back?
    - Is it spam?

- Regression:
    - What will be the temperature tomorrow?
    - What is the projected net income for the next season?
    - How much inventory should we have? 

- Optimization:
    - What is the best route to deliver the packages?
    - What is the optimal advertisement strategy to promote a new product?
